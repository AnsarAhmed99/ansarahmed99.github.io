      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate and self-driven professional with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science (specializing in Cybersecurity) and a Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering. With over four years of teaching experience in both private and government institutions, I have developed strong instructional, leadership, and communication skills, enabling me to simplify complex topics and foster student engagement and work effectively in any organization.

My academic journey reflects consistent growth and a deep interest in interdisciplinary domains, particularly where electronics and computer science intersect. I am especially skilled in cybersecurity concepts, network protocols, troubleshooting, and problem-solving, with a strong inclination toward continuous learning and hands-on experimentation.

I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world environments whether through research, collaborative projects, or industry roles and am highly motivated to contribute meaningfully to both academic institutions and forward thinking organizations. I am also exploring global opportunities to further my education and professional development, with a strong commitment to excellence, adaptability, and ethical responsibility.</p>
